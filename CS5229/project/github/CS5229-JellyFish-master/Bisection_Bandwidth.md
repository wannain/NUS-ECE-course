## Bisection bandwidth

**For Fat-tree:**

```
Input: N(number of servers), k(k-port switches)
Output: N/2
```

Relationship: N=(k^3)/8



**For jellyfish:** 

Based on the lower bound of Bollobas

```
Input: N(number of servers),k(k-port switches), r(r-regular graph)
Output: N[r/4-sqrt(r*ln2)/2]
```
